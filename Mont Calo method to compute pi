##### Mont Calo method to compute pi #####

# x-axis value of points
x <- runif(1000,0,2)
# y-axis value of points
y <- runif(1000,0,2)

# every row of z stands for a point
z <- cbind(x,y)
as.matrix(z)

# set the center of circle 
cen <-c(1,1)

# a function to compute the distence between different points to the center (1,1)
DistenceFromCenter <- function(x){
  sqrt(sum((x-cen)^2))
}

# compute the distence between every points to center(1,1) , save the results as a vector
distence <- apply(z,1,DistenceFromCenter)

# compute distence of every points to the center
for (i in 1:100000) {
  dis[i] <- DistenceFromCenter(x[i],y[i])
}

dis <- dis[1:100000]

# calculathe the pi by the ratio : [number of points in the circle/all points]
4*mean(distence<1)
